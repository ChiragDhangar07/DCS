Innovative solutions that keep up with current technological developments will benefit both learners and institutions. Data literacy, user experience, and workforce training programs may all benefit from using Salesforce&#8217;s Education Cloud products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:500\"><strong>1. Making Use of Data Literacy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Salesforce capabilities that allow you to effortlessly gather, view, analyze, understand, and share data make scaling your education technology system viable. According to the Salesforce Connected Student Report, 31% of university teachers and staff believe their school employs many technology platforms and that getting the data they need to execute their jobs successfully is tough. With Salesforce, you can operate on a single platform that allows you to make data-driven choices at any stage of the student lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:500\">Salesforce can assist institutions by:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1.) Monitor trends in application and enrollment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.) Identify problematic pupils for early intervention automatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.) Recruit and handle potential donors<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.) Communicate survey results and interpret them<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.) Examine space utilization<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.) Compare to peer institutions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.) Demonstrate fiscal responsibility<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.) Improve departmental communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:500\"><strong>2. Optimizing the User Experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From recruiting and admissions to student achievement, <strong>Salesforce CRM consultants<\/strong>&nbsp;provide a one-stop shop with user-friendly capabilities! More than 90% of Cloud&#8217;s education clients place a premium on improving the user experience for their constituencies (students, employees, parents\/guardians, instructors, partners, and administration). <a href=\"https:\/\/techabled.in\/salesforce-services\/experience-cloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Salesforce experience cloud<\/strong><\/a> allows universities to get a 360-degree perspective of their students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:500\"><strong>3. Bringing Workforce Training Programs and Connections Together<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategic alignment across K-12, postsecondary education, and the workforce are being emphasized by educational institutions and the industry. Software is replacing manually managed workforce development opportunities and partnerships with groundbreaking automation targeted at speedy and effective communication between students and professors with the aid of the Education Cloud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techabled.in\/salesforce-services\/salesforce-cloud-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Salesforce Cloud platform<\/a><\/strong> can assist schools by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.)

The experience component is critical to total learner success, and it begins long before a student even sets foot on campus for the first time. The initial encounter a potential student has with your school sets the tone for the type of experience they will have once enrolled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Educational institutions have also witnessed firsthand the ability to leverage technology to scale the extraordinary efforts of their teachers and staff.&#8221; That isn&#8217;t going away anytime soon, in my opinion. Indeed, I see institutions continue to learn from one another, exchanging digital engagement ideas and discovering new methods to improve the student experience. I also see a lot of opportunity in Education Cloud (<strong>salesforce cloud platform<\/strong>)&nbsp;for powering those digital experiences with a single linked platform across the student journey.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techabled.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Techabled<\/a><\/strong> is a proud Salesforce consulting partner for some of the best-connected products in the Salesforce ecosystem.
