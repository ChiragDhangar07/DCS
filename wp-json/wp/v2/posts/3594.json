Healthcare is hardly an exception; in fact, it might gain more than others from extensive linkages. The typical hospital employs 16 different Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, according to research by HIMSS Analytics.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>EHR systems are only the start. Additionally, there are test results, billing and marketing data, insurance claims systems, and more to take into account. Having this amount of data dispersed across several platforms isn&#8217;t really helpful. All of it is connected with Salesforce. Healthcare professionals may work more effectively, make better judgments, and devote more time to patient care when all of a patient&#8217;s typically isolated data is gathered in one convenient location.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. <strong>Make Wise Use of Data<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Speaking of data, Salesforce can use its analytical prowess to enhance health results when it is incorporated into a single system. Healthcare professionals are provided with actionable data via tools like Tableau CRM (formerly Einstein Analytics), allowing them to anticipate and proactively meet patient demands. By using risk stratification, high-risk patients may be found and enrolled in the appropriate care management program. Salesforce can get data from wearable devices like fitness trackers and help with post-discharge care for chronic diseases that need monitoring. In conclusion, Salesforce makes it simpler for healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions that improve patient outcomes and provider-patient satisfaction.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. <strong>Promote improved care team cooperation<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to develop Care Teams made up of members of a patient&#8217;s care community, healthcare professionals can use Salesforce Health Cloud, which expands on the capabilities of Service Cloud. These might be made up of specialists, primary care doctors, domestic helpers, or anybody else connected to a patient&#8217;s treatment. Individuals may use any device to access a unified care management plan, assign tasks, and communicate with other team members depending on their position. They may leverage Live Agent and Knowledge, among other Service Cloud features.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. <strong>Maintain Data Security While Continually Innovating<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Healthcare firms are extremely concerned about data security. Breach costs millions of dollars and potentially endangers patient safety. Fortunately, Salesforce makes it simple for healthcare organizations to keep control of their data and adhere to HIPAA and HITRUST regulations. Healthcare companies may make sure that electronically protected health information (ePHI) is secured and only accessed by authorized users using Salesforce Shield in combination with Health Cloud. They can also keep track of user interactions and keep an audit trail of field data.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techabled.in\/salesforce-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salesforce<\/a><\/strong> Health Cloud makes this possible in a variety of ways, but the major advantage is that it offers a thorough, 360-degree picture of the patient. This enables healthcare companies to deliver the caliber of service that contemporary patients want through the intelligent use of data at every stage of the care experience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Salesforce and similar products are acquainted with the specialists at <a href=\"https:\/\/techabled.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Techabled (a Salesforce Consulting partner)<\/strong><\/a>.
