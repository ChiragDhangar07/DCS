<h2><a href="https://techabled.in/what-is-lead-management-software/"><strong>What is Lead management software?</strong></a></h2>



<p><br>Starting obviously from what is a lead? A lead is defined as someone who expresses an interest in a company&#8217;s product or service in any manner, shape, or form.</p>



<p><br>Leads typically hear from a business or organization after initiating the contact (by submitting personal information for an offer, trial, or subscription) rather than receiving a cold call from someone who purchased their contact information.<br>From a business standpoint, the information the car firm gathers about you from your survey replies allows them to customize that initial contact to target your existing needs — rather than wasting time phoning leads who aren&#8217;t interested in-vehicle services.</p>



<p><br><strong>Qualified Marketing Lead (MQL)</strong><br>Marketing-qualified leads are those who have interacted with your marketing team but aren&#8217;t ready to get a sales call. A contact who fills out a landing page form for an offer is an example of an MQL.</p>



<p><br><strong>Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)</strong><br>Contacts who have performed steps that demonstrate their desire to become paying customers are considered sales-qualified leads. A contact who fills out a form to ask a question about your product or service is an example of SQL.</p>



<p><br><strong>Product Qualified Lead (PQL)</strong><br>PQLs are generally used by organizations that give a free or restricted version of their product with the opportunity to upgrade, which is where your sales force comes in.</p>



<p><br><strong>Service Qualified Lead</strong><br>Contacts or customers who have signaled to your service staff that they are interested in becoming paying customers are considered service-qualified leads.</p>



<p><br><strong>LEAD MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE</strong></p>



<p><br>Lead Management software, also known as Customer Acquisition Management, is a set of methodologies, practices, and procedures used to acquire new customers for a company. Lead Management Tools, which are utilized by both small and large enterprises, have evolved to meet this demand.<br>All organizations require easy-to-use solutions for building and maintaining client databases and sales leads. This article discusses the top lead management tools on the market, as well as their features and comparison.</p>
