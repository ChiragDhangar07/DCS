<p>Salesforce is a cloud-based software development firm that assists organizations in integrating diverse departments, stakeholders, and data in order to boost sales and close more transactions. Since its inception in 1999, the business has gone a long way, creating a global customer base.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://techabled.in/salesforce-services/experience-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salesforce experience cloud</a></strong> is one of the company&#8217;s most innovative technologies in recent years. Unlike other software packages, this one is a whole suite of products rather than a single product. So far, various software has functioned independently to collect and use data in order to deliver a smooth experience to a department.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:600">Key Features:</h2>



<p>The few lines above are insufficient to convey Salesforce 360&#8217;s (<strong>salesforce experience cloud</strong>) capabilities and competencies. So, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the features that Salesforce has included in its 360 version.</p>



<p>1. Data and Consent Management Integration</p>



<p>One of the most important features of Salesforce 360 is the ability to unify data and consent management. Firms may use this service to collect data and insights about consumers in order to construct a comprehensive customer profile. Consent Management assists the first-party member in managing the data of known or unknown consumers in the form of cookies. Once the framework&#8217;s approval is obtained, the company grants access to this information to its different divisions in order to improve decision-making across the organization.</p>



<p><strong>2. Better Audience Segmentation</strong></p>



<p>Businesses may now exploit data gathering and administration on a segmentation basis with an enhanced version of audience segmentation. Organizational departments may now utilize data from a certain gender, age, demographic location, consumers with purchase patterns, and much more. It makes it easy for different departments inside the company to establish appropriate plans.</p>



<p>For example, the sales department will only approach those who have the potential to become customers of the company. Simultaneously, the marketing team will employ the appropriate technology to approach the consumer.</p>



<p><strong>3. Individualized Customer Engagement</strong></p>



<p>Firms can simply leverage customer data to deliver a tailored experience using Salesforce Customer 360. Personalized client interaction, without a doubt, helps complete more business since it focuses on the specific problem or difficulty the consumers have and the type of solution they need.</p>

<p><strong>4. Optimization through Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>



<p>Artificial intelligence makes it simpler for businesses to study consumer behavior and improve their customer relationships in the future. For example, it examines the number of clicks on a certain ad, items purchased in recent months, and information from user profiles, and utilizes all of this information to offer things to the customer.</p>



<p><strong>5. Follow-up Feature to Help You Close More Deals</strong></p>



<p>While many customers fill their carts, very few bring them to the checkout. As a result, Salesforce has created new functionality for this case. The new marketing cloud tool provides many incentives, discounts, and appealing coupons to customers in order to move the abandoned basket to the execution phase.</p>



<p>In a word, Salesforce Customer 360 gives the experience of a comprehensive solution that increases the organization&#8217;s internal operational process. The solution assists firms in adopting a more centralized strategy by integrating various applications and thereby departments. This way, before addressing consumers, they know enough about them to take the appropriate action. As a result, the solution plays an important role in completing agreements by offering clients with a tailored experience.</p>
