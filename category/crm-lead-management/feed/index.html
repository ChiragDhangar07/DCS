<p>According to Salesforce, Einstein GPT for sales will combine real-time data with generative AI to improve purchase recommendations and personalize the shopping experience, and a new Composable Storefront page designer will assist merchants and marketers in creating unique commerce experiences on headless sites.</p>



<p>Customer happiness has always been a top priority for every firm, and the benefits of using artificial intelligence for customer service are numerous. An increasing number of firms are utilizing AI to boost their brand reputation, client loyalty, and overall company performance. AI may be utilized in all elements of marketing, sales, and service, as well as customer relationship management (<strong>CRM lead management</strong>) &#8211; a sector in which firms use AI to get consumer insights. When we think about <strong>CRM lead management</strong>, the first thing that comes to mind is Salesforce. Salesforce&#8217;s artificial intelligence (AI) for <strong>CRM lead management</strong>, Einstein, has been empowering agents. With its comprehensive capabilities, Einstein helps many businesses to transition to intelligent customer service.</p>



<p>Einstein GPT for sales may produce tailored product listings or interactions for each consumer without preloaded product descriptions or information entered on the back end by leveraging customer demographic data and buying history via Data Cloud.</p>



<p>Sales Cloud features will assist retailers in creating seamless, personalized experiences across any commerce platform. Businesses may also create custom-tailored promotional offers that include personalized auto-generated communications to clients through WhatsApp, SMS, and email. Using a drag-and-drop editor and reusable components, a page designer for Composable Storefront helps control the site experience and develop sophisticated landing pages. In addition, the page designer includes React utilities for a headless page editor.</p>

Sales representatives will no longer have to manually enter sales data.</p>



<p>Composable Storefront accelerators, integrations, and pricing from Salesforce partners Astound, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DEPT, Valtech, IBM, Forward, and Uniform are also available.</p>
